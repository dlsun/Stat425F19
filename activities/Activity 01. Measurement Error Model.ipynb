    "# Measurement Error Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, all measurements are made with imperfect measuring devices. One common model for measurement error is the following: the measurements $X_1, ..., X_n$ follow a normal distribution around mean $\\mu$, where $\\mu$ is the true value we are trying to measure. (The SD is assumed to be known; for simplicity, we assume it is equal to $1$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we make $n=9$ measurements. One possible estimator of $\\mu$ is the _mean_ of the 9 measurements; another estimator is the _median_ of the 9 measurements. Which is better?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's calculate the bias of each estimator. The code below specifies the model for $9$ independent measurements from a normal distribution with $\\mu = 0$."
